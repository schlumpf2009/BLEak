BLE + ATMega Kit

Meet BLEak - the BLE + ATMega Kit.  This is a board I'm building for a one-day workshop in San Francisco.  The board includes the NRF8001 + ATMega328-AUR (SMD, a'la Arduino SMD) and should include some basic SPI sensors / IO.  Existing Arduino SW libraries for the nrf8001 should work with BLEak.  The basis of the workshop is to show the transition from Arduino to a production PCB and BLEak is a nice narrative that mixes some simple wireless / RF with the ATMega in a module that just might be the prodcut someone is trying to build.
